I'm a computational scientist and software developer specializing in large-scale condensed matter physics simulations. With a background spanning theoretical chemistry, materials science, and physics, I bring a unique blend of scientific knowledge and programming expertise to the world of scientific software development.


Research Interests
======
With a doctoral research experience in Theoretical Chemistry from TU Dresden and hands-on experience at Software for Chemistry & Materials B.V. (SCM), I specialize in translating intricate scientific concepts into efficient, scalable code. My work focuses on:
* Optical propertise of twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) heterostructures
* Modeling and simulation of large-scale systems
* Development and implementation of semi-empirical quantum chemistry method


Developed Packages
