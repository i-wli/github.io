I'm a computational scientist and software developer specializing in condensed matter physics simulations. With a background spanning theoretical chemistry, materials science, and physics, I am passionate about transforming complex scientific concepts into efficient, scalable code.


Research Interests
======
Building on my doctoral research in at TU Dresden and hands-on experience at Software for Chemistry & Materials B.V. (SCM), I focuses on:
* Optical propertise of twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) heterostructures
* Modeling and simulating large-scale systems
* Developing and implementing semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods


Developed Packages
